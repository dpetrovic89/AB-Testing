## A/B Test Analysis for Advertising Campaigns
Introduction
This document provides an overview of the A/B test conducted to optimize advertising campaigns. The goal of the experiment was to increase the number of "sign_up" and "purchase" events. The analysis includes segmentation into control and alternative groups, visualization, statistical observations, and strategic recommendations.

## Methodology
The data was segmented into two groups:

Control Group: Exhibited positive engagement but did not translate into desired actions.
Alternative Group: Showcased better interaction on the website, leading to desired outcomes.
Visualization of Events
A comparison of different events between the control and alternative groups was visualized as percentages, providing insights into the distribution of user interactions.

## Detailed Analysis
Control Group: Encouraging engagement with more time spent on the website, but lacked desired actions like sign-ups or purchases.
Alternative Group: Demonstrated enhanced user interaction and success in achieving "sign_up" and "purchase" events.
